# Project Description

On Thursday, 14 April 2022, [Sharp and Benning in the Morning](https://mobile.twitter.com/sharpandbenning) referenced a tweet from [Kaleb Henry](https://mobile.twitter.com/iKalebHenry) highlighting the gap in performance between the Big 3 Women's sports (Basketball/Softball/Volleyball) at Nebraska as compared to the Big 3 Men's sports (Baseball/Basketball/Football).

The goal of this analysis is to look across all of NCAA Division I athletics to see how Nebraska's 2021-22 performance compares to other Universities extending as far back as the data allows.
